# The Early Impact of COVID-19 Stressors on Children's Depression and Anxiety Symptoms and the Role of Pre-Pandemic Authoritative Parenting

### This repo contains the scripts in R that were used to conduct the primary analyses for this project. 

### In addition, you will find a de-identified dataset used to complete the primary analyses (scripts 5-14). Please note that script 6 creates subsets of the main dataset that do not include identified multivariate statistical outliers based on specific models. To protect the privacy of the participants in the dataset, dates have been removed from the dataset. Please note that scripts may contain reference to dates - these sections are provided for transparency purposes but should be removed.

### The analysis scripts were written by Nicolas L. Camacho.
